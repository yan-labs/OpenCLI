## Prerequisites

- Chrome running and **logged into** bilibili.com
- [Browser Bridge extension](/guide/browser-bridge) installed

## Notes

- `opencli bilibili feed` without `uid` reads your following feed
- `opencli bilibili feed <uid-or-name>` reads a specific user's dynamics
- `opencli bilibili favorite` defaults to the first favorite folder when `--fid` is omitted
- `feed-detail` expects the dynamic ID from a `https://t.bilibili.com/<id>` URL
- `comments` emits `rpid`; pass a top-level row's `rpid` to `comments --parent` to read its reply thread
- `comments --limit` accepts `1..50`; empty comment lists raise `EmptyResultError`
- `comments --top` returns only pinned comments (from the API's `top_replies`); it cannot be combined with `--parent`, and a video with no pinned comment raises `EmptyResultError`
- `comment` is a write command and refuses to post unless `--execute` is passed
- `comment --parent` expects the top-level/root `rpid`; nested reply-to-reply targeting is not inferred
- `follow` and `unfollow` are write commands; they no-op when the current relation already matches the requested state and otherwise re-read `/x/relation` after modify before reporting success
- `follow` and `unfollow` accept numeric UID, exact `space.bilibili.com/<uid>` profile URL, or a name that resolves through Bilibili search
- `creator-stats` uses the logged-in creator-center session and searches the comparison endpoint's latest 100 manuscript rows. A missing BVID is reported as empty because it may be older, not owned by this account, or not analyzed yet; absence does not prove an ownership or login failure.
- The command emits a fixed manuscript-level metric family as `{ bvid, metric, value, unit }`. Counts use `count`, duration uses `seconds`, and documented basis-point rates are normalized to `percent` in the 0–100 range. A `null` value means that individual metric has not been generated yet.
- The comparison endpoint is undocumented and treated as an internal, unstable contract: missing or malformed required fields fail closed instead of silently changing the output schema. The command does not claim per-part retention analytics.
